This problem can be solved using a brute force algorithm without too 
much trouble. We simply consider every possible fold, adding to a list 
of possible solutions as we find folds that can produce the given gold 
leaf. At the end, we sort that list based on the priority given in the 
problem statement, and display the best one. One interesting observation 
is that we don't need to write code to evaulate each possible fold type, 
but instead can apply transformations to the gold leaf itself to reduce
the number of types of folds to check.
