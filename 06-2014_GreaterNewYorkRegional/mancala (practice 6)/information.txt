This problem asks us to find a winning Tchoukaillon board of a given 
number of counters. The problem statement tells us that the solution for 
each count is unique, and so it must be the case that the winning board 
for n counters can produce the winning board for n-1 counters after a 
single move. This allows us to describe a recursive relationship between 
the winning boards of different counts, and hence we can use an 
iterative algorithm to precompute the solutions up to the maximum count 
requested in the problem statement.
