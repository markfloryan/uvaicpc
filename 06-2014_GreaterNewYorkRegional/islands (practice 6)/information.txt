This problem asks us to find the number of subarrays in a given array such 
that each element in the subarray is strictly greater than the elements 
immediately before and after the subarray. Since the size of the array is 
fixed (12), we can simply count all possible (i, j) pairs, i < j, such that 
the property is met for A[i..j]. This is implemented here as a double for 
loop.
